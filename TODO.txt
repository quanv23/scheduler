What I'm currently working on:
- current working on new card form to build into completing CRUD 
- Need to stylize the input forms to have white border and turns red when in focus 

1. Set up google firebase 
    - Learn how to use the API
    - Allow it to store information regarding the cards 
    - Set up auto delete when dates pass (FINAL)
    - Make sure to properly set up and update the states 
    - Basically CRUD (create, read, update, delete)

2. Create form for creating new cards 
    - This component should also be used when editing previous cards, but change some stuff 
    - Should obviously also change things inside the database as well 
    - Add implementation that allows user to create their own categories and choose their own colours 

3. Add implementation for editing card 
    - This should go hand and hand with creating new cards 

4. Implement delete card button  
    - Remove button from view and database 
    - Make a "Are you sure" view 

5. Implement log in functionalitly 
    - Must also create login view 
    - Allow for multiple accounts 
    - Maybe change nav button into just a logout button (that also uses the are you sure component)

6. Implement calendar view which should open a new screen 
    - Or at least swap out card-container with the calendar-container? 
    - Honestly anything like that works 
    - Should display the cards on a calendar instead of being simply listed 

7. Miscellaneous things
    - Create better visual indication of important, something that stands out more
    - Also include priority display so that important meetings are always displayed first
    - Include filter by category
